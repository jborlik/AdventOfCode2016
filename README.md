Python code for the Advent Of Code puzzles for December 2016


http://adventofcode.com/

All code is in Python (tested on 3.5.2).


* Day 1 - Follow path w/ right/left directions.  Used complex numbers and segment intersection.
    This (part2) segment intersection could probably be made much simpler, to take advantage
    of the 90-degree turns (half of the segments to check are always going to be parallel).
